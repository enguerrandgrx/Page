# Visualising the airplane crashes since 1908
In this project, we will realise an interactive visualisation of the airplane crashes since 1908.

## Data describtion: 
Full history of airplane crashes throughout the world, from 1908-present.

## Link to Data: 
https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq

## Aim of visaualisation: 
Our visualisation gives a way for plane crashes analists to draw useful insights and intelligent hypothesis to be tested
related to the different aspects of a crash: date, number of injured/dead people, airline operator, departure/arrival cities,
location of the crash...

## The visualisaton in details:
The visualisation has 3 views.

### 1. Map:
The map shows the flights where the filters introduced by the user are verified. 
Every flight is a an edge from a departure city to the planned arrival city with a cross where the accident occurred.
In the map you can filter the flights by:
- Type: Military/ Non-military
- Year: Range of years during which the crash occurred
- Number of deaths: number of victims of that flight
When the mouse of the user is put on an edge, further details about the crash are visualised.

### 2. Plot of the number of deaths per year
This view is located on the bottom of the map.
It captures the range of years the user interested in and plot the total number of injuries/deaths for every year.
When the mouse of the user is put on a year, the crashes in that year are hilighted in the map. 

### 3. Top 10 airline operators bar chart:
This bar chart contains the 10 most dangerous airline operators for the range of years introduced by the user
When the mouse of the user is put on a bar, the crashes corresponding to that airline are hilighted in the map.
